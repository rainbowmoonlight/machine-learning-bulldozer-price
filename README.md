# bulldozer-price

Machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for.

The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.
